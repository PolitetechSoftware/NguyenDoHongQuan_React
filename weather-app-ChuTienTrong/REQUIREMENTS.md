# Objective:
Develop a weather app using React and TypeScript that allows users to search for cities and filter them by current temperature, using data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Requirements:
### 1. Tech Stack:
- **React & TypeScript**: Use React for UI and TypeScript for type safety.
- **No Additional Libraries**: Rely only on built-in React and JavaScript/TypeScript features.
### 2. Features:
- **City Search**: Implement a search bar to find cities by name.
- **Temperature Filtering**: Enable filtering of cities based on current temperature.
- **API Integration**: Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap and handle responses, loading, and errors.
### 3. User Interface:
- Design a clean, responsive UI displaying city names, temperatures, and weather conditions.
### 4. Code Quality:
- Follow React and TypeScript best practices with strong typing, clean code, and reusable components.
# Deliverables:
- A zip file of source code.
- README with setup instructions.
# Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality, code quality, UI/UX, and API handling.
